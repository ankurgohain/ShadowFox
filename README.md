# ShadowFox Python Development Internship Submission

This is the end submission of Ankur Gohain for the role of a Python Development Intern @ShadowFox for the period of 1st July, 2025 to 30th July, 2025. The tasks completed by me are ordered in their respective folders. The tasks submitted are all completed by me, with minimal use of any AI tools; which were used to only tweak out a few errors encountered. 


## Beginner Level

We start off with the Beginner Level section. This helped me with strengthening my skills in 
 - variable naming
 - understaning reserved keywords
 - working with lists, conditional and looping statements
 - basics of object oriented concepts of inheritence in Python

Even if the prgrams and problem statements looked easy, these fundamentals are the bedrock to programming even more complex programs and projects in Python.

## Intermediate Level

The next section, being Intermediate Level exposed me to the world of web scraping and user interactive programming using the command line. 
Web scraping helps us to extract data from any web site available on the internet, helping to download entire web pages inclusive of any media attachements. This is done by "copying" the web page to out local machine. In my implementation I have provided a very simple example of extracting the text from a example website. The program searches through the page and then based on a predetermined length (to prevent any system crashes, especially on very large web pages) of 5000 characters, which showcases the basic principle and working of the web scraper. 
The Hangman game might look silly to some, but its real world applications are very important. This problem statement explores the world of user interactive applications, teaching us how to program the backend to accept a user input, provide them with visuals and hints at each step. It helped me with providing clear and well-defined context for the user; be it hints, visualising the picture of the hangman using strings etc, thus enhacing their interaction with the program. The hangman pictures are hardcoded in ASCII art, which is declared as a string in the program.
